# RSL Sell Files

This repo contains original and modified Lil Endgame RSLHelper artifact sell files.

The sell rules are split into tiers S+, S, A, B.  
These rules have not been modified, as they are comprehensive and restrictive.  

The A tier rules are a good filter for off-set pieces in a 'Pre-End Game' account.  
Therefore, the Modified files have all artifact sets added to A tier and have the sell all bad artifacts (rule 17) removed.  

The table information below should help with modifying your preferred artifact sets.  
In a text editor, search using the default text and replace with your modified set list.
